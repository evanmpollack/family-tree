# Family Tree Project

## Overview
I family member has been maintaining an Excel sheet of geneaolgy data. It is really hard to read, so I wanted to create a web app on top of it to make it easier to view the relationships between family members and siginificant locations.
My goal for this app is to have 2 views: an interactable map where family members can see locations of births, current locations, place of death, and place of rest, and an interactable family tree that highlights the relationships between family
members. My hope is that this makes the data my relative worked hard to compile and maintain more digestable and engaging.
